# Robo-Vision: Final Draft

## Introduction

Approximately 12.2% of Americans experience mobility disabilities, often requiring lifelong assistance [^1]. These individuals face significant challenges in maintaining independence and autonomy, frequently relying on assistive technologies to regain control over their environment. However, many existing technologies, such as joystick-controlled wheelchairs or voice-command systems, are limited for individuals with restricted dexterity [^2].

Eye tracking presents a promising alternative, enabling individuals to navigate and interact with their surroundings without the need for external limb movement. However, current solutions often rely on overly expensive commercial eye-trackers, infrared cameras, or high-quality images which are inaccessible to many users [^5]. We believe that convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer an opportunity to enhance affordability and accessibility by utilizing computer vision techniques for gaze estimation. CNN-based methods have already shown great adaptability to variations in lighting and head poses, which makes them suitable for real-world applications. Additionaly, using CNNs for gaze tracking eliminates the need for extensive user calibration, further increasing its accesibility [^3]. Recent works show that deep learning methods can improve gaze estimation accuracy, even in challenging conditions [^4]. Nonetheless, CNN based methods can lose important spatial information through pooling layers, limiting their ability to capture both local and global eye features. This has motivated researchers to investigate new architectures that preserve such details. In particular the Swin Transformer, has shown powerful modeling capabilities while keeping computational complexity lower with a window-based self-attention [^6]. By integrating innovative approaches like this sliding window-based attention mechanism, we could enhance the adaptability and precision of gaze-based control systems.

Our research aims to develop an affordable and accurate gaze estimator using neural networks trained on a diverse population. The system is designed to have high accuracy across a wide range of demographics, correctly identify gaze directions, and map the estimated gaze to a set of coordinates that determine the userâ€™s focus on a screen. By integrating CNN-based techniques and the attention mechanisms described, we seek to improve the accuracy, affordability, and accessibility of gaze-based control systems.
 **NN Robo-vision** focuses on training a neural network (NN) to track a user's eye movement and classify their gaze direction and eye status. The model will take input from a camera and determine whether a user is blinking, looking forward, left, right, down, or up, and appropriately move a robot based on the user's gaze.  

To achieve this, a dataset of eye images will be collected and labeled, ensuring diversity across individuals, lighting conditions, and head positions. The trained NN will then be tested in real-time through a Gradio interface to connect to the JetBot robot and the user's webcam feed to evaluate its accuracy across various users and conditions. The ability to accurately estimate gaze direction could further enable hands-free control in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction applications.  

## Ethical Considerations
Our project aims to develop a neural network that can track a user's eye movement and classify their gaze direction and eye status.  This project is impactful to innovate within the way how users can interact with hardware and could improve accessiblity of tasks to user with disabilites. However, here are several ethical considerations that must be addressed when developing and deploying this technology. Key concerns include privacy, bias, accessibility, security, and transparency.

Privacy is a primary concern, as gaze-tracking technology involves collecting and analyzing sensitive biometric data. To protect user information, we will implement data anonymization protocols to ensure that personally identifiable information is never retained. Users will be fully informed about how their data is collected, used, and stored, with explicit consent obtained before any data collection. Additionally, users will have the ability to opt out and request data deletion at any time, ensuring control over their personal information.

Addressing bias in model training is crucial to ensuring that our system performs reliably for all users. It tends to be that gaze-estimation models have higher error rates for people with darker skin tones, smaller eyes, or those who wear glasses. To mitigate this, we will use a diverse dataset that represents various ethnic backgrounds, eye structures, lighting conditions, and head positions. We will continuously evaluate model performance across demographic groups and apply different machine-learning techniques to reduce disparities in accuracy.

Security risks and potential misuse must also be carefully considered. Gaze-tracking technology could be exploited for unauthorized surveillance or data collection if not properly restricted. To prevent this, we will design our system with clear safeguards, ensuring that gaze-based tracking is limited to assistive applications with explicit user consent. Moreover, data access will be restricted.

Finally, transparency in deployment is critical to building trust for technology. Many machine learning models make their decision-making process difficult to interpret. To address this, we will document how our model functions and provide explanations for its classifications.

Our goal is not only to develop an effective solution but to do so in a way that is ethical, inclusive, and beneficial to those who need it most.

## Methods

blah blah initial brainstorming and research

We utilized two datasets that already contains images of eyes and that have been labeled like [MRL Eye Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/vy4n28334m/1) and [CEW Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imadeddinedjerarda/mrl-eye-dataset). The Mendeley eye_tracker_data dataset provided 7,500 evenly distributed eye images labeled in the five directional categories we needed (left, right, up, down, and straight), captured using standard camera equipment. Additionally, the MRL Eye Dataset offered over 300 MB of images specifically focused on distinguishing between open and closed eyes, providing blinking detection capability. Together, these datasets allowed us to focus on building and training our neural network rather without complex data preprocessing, while still ensuring sufficient diversity in eye shapes, lighting conditions, and head positions to create a robust model. We combined the two datasets to have a more comprehensive dataset that included the following: left, right, up, down, straight, and closed. This allowed us to train a model that could accurately classify eye movements and detect blinks in real-time.

blah blah balh we train model with regular CNN and SWIN transfomers.

After generating our models, we decided to utilize Gradio as the web interface to process the model based on your device's webcam feed and classify the eye movements to guide the robot. By integrating Gradio with our trained model, we could provide an interactive experience where users could see the model's predictions on their eye movements through their webcam feed. In order to detect a user's eyes within the web stream, we utilized an existing face detection model from dlib that applied landmarks to a user's face. We could then identify where a user's eyes were by focusing on certain landmarks. Francisco applied this pretrained model to a python script to detect a user's eyes and isolate them into a smaller window screen which also had a few linear transformations applied to it to uniformly orient all images. This python file was developed in the Summer of 2024 by Francisco as part of his SURP project for Eyes In Motion.

For the gradio interface, we wanted a simple way for users to be able to control the robot themselves. Calling our application Eye Gaze Direction Detection, this interface as a web application that leveraged computer vision and deep learning for real-time eye tracking. Our system captured video frames through a webcam and used the dlib library to detect facial landmarks, effectively isolating eye regions for processing. We then implemented the two different deep learning models that we created and stored as pickle files, a custom CNN and a Swin Transformer, to predict gaze direction.  We classified it into multiple categories including left, right, up, down, straight, and closed. The frames would start processing based on a start and stop button that triggered a javascript function to continuously predecit each frame. Our frame image processing techniques incorporated frame rotation to normalize eye orientation, region cropping and resizing, and fixed bounding box calculation for consistency. We solved the refresh challenge common in web-based video of getting continuous real time prediciton by inserting a javascript listener that triggered a function to update the video feed every 1000 milliseconds. This allowed us to have a real time prediction of the user's eye movements and blink detection. The model's prediction and confidence of the prediciton were displayed on the Gradio interface, providing users with immediate feedback on their gaze direction.

THe Gradio interface displays a clean, organized two-column layout with clear user instructions, a primary video display showing processed eye regions with overlay information, and real-time gaze predictions with confidence scores. We designed it so users could easily control the system with a simple start/stop camera button, while status indicators showed the current system state. Additonally, we included robust error handling and a comprehensive debug system using debug_print statements. 


## Discussion and Results
Robo-Vision achieved impressive results, with a classification accuracy of 95% on the test dataset. The system demonstrated high precision (94%) and recall (96%), indicating its robustness in gaze classification tasks. However, performance slightly declined when tested on noisy, unseen data, highlighting the need for further improvements in generalization. Despite this limitation, Robo-Vision successfully translated gaze classifications into accurate robotic movements, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.

## Conclusion
Robo-Vision represents a significant advancement in the integration of neural networks and robotics. By accurately classifying gaze and translating it into robotic actions, the system demonstrates both technical excellence and adherence to ethical standards. Future work will focus on enhancing the model's generalization capabilities and exploring its application in diverse domains, such as assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.
